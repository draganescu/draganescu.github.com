###The Raster specification implemented in PHP

RasterPHP is the Raster framework written in PHP. My goal is to have it written in all the major scripting languages JS, Ruby and Phython. 

RasterPHP is available as a standalone framework, as a Code Igniter library and as an Wordpress Plugin. For CI and WP it does the best available to add the RTO pattern in those frameworks.

- RasterPHP - standalone
- RasterPHP for Code Igniter
- RasterPHP for Wordpress

RasterJS
The raster implementation with NodeJS

Raster is an implementation of the RTO design pattern. Currently i have written Raster using PHP and now i have started the NodeJS version. 

As a sole contributor the speed of development is ... snail with bursts of jet plane. Not good, therefore i am out looking for more people to contribute to any part of the project that fits their fancy.
