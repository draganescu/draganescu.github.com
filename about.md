title: About RTO and Raster
---

RTO is a design pattern aiming to ease website development. Raster is a specification on how to implement the RTO design pattern in a web framework.

The first framework implemented on the Raster specification is RasterPHP.
Because RTO is a pattern aiming to help all website developers RasterPHP is available also as a Wordpress plugin and as a Code Igniter library.

The next implementation of Raster is RasterJS using nodeJS as the server.

The aim is to implement Raster in all major web scripting languages: PHP, JS, Ruby and Python.

## What is RTO
The Request, Template, Object design pattern is grown out of MVC but adapted to the process of building a website as opposed to building an webapp.

## What is Raster
Raster is a framework implementing the RTO design pattern. The architecture of the framework is based on a fixed set of principles and tries to make an easier entry into the UX-IA-PM web development methodology.

## What is UX/IA/PM
UX/IA/PM is a global acrynom for a web development methodology that elegantly solves the merger between designing interaction, building the software for it and delivering working products on time.
